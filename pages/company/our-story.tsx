            Jim and Wendy Sherrill are seasoned veterans of the vacation home
            rental market with their own properties located in Young, Arizona.
            Their frustration with the major OTAs and their outrageous service
            fees led them to be immediate and early investors in VacaRent, LLC.

            Mark and Michelle Hendricks do not have a background in short term
            rentals but they know smart investments when they come along. Within
            2 days of discussions both agreed to finance and back VacaRent.
            Seeing the frustration of so many homeowners looking for a new
            option to compete was especially exciting for them.

            Bill owns many vacation rental homes, ranging from Illinois to
            Missouri to Florida. As soon as he heard of a website being launched
            that combined "Vacation" and "Rentals" together in the URL, he knew
            immediately that he had to be a part of it.
