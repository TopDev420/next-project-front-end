        is a Vacation Travel Site
      </p>
      <p>
        This website provides a method and means to introduce and connect
        travelers with homeowners for the intent of establishing short term
        rentals. Vacation.Rentals By VacaRent By VacaRent is not involved in any
        ownership or management of the properties listed and as such has
        absolutely no means of verification of the actual property listed, the
        quality of listings, or the legality of the listing.{' '}
        <b>
          Each transaction is <u>strictly and only the responsibility</u> of the
          traveler and property owner to verify
        </b>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Your submission of a property for inclusion is{' '}
        <b>
          <u>not guaranteed</u>
        </b>
        . Each property submitted will be reviewed and additional information
        may be required before an approval can be given. If your submission is
        rejected, you are not entitled to explanation beyond what the site admin
        deems necessary. You will not be charged if your property is rejected.
        You can appeal your rejected status by filing an appeal to{' '}
        <a href="mailto:sales@vacarent.com">sales@vacarent.com</a>. Inclusion
        into the Site is a privilege and not a right. As such, any approved
        listing can be suspended or terminated for cause as determined by the
        Site owner and admin.

      <h2>Definition of a homeowner</h2>
      <p>
        A homeowner is someone who rents property they own directly for short
        term rentals. A homeowner does not utilize a management company to
        oversee their property and as such interacts and handles every aspect of
        their rentals directly.
      </p>
      <h2>Definition of a property manager</h2>
      <p>
        A property manager is either a person or a company who manages numerous
        short term rentals on behalf of individual owners or entities. They are
        not the direct owner of the listed property but have all authority to
        act on behalf of the owners, including the listing of property for rent
        on this Site.
      </p>
      <h2>Accuracy in listing</h2>
      <p>
        When submitting a listing to the Site of your property or properties,
        you are guaranteeing that the property you submit is either yours
        directly or you have authority as a property manager to list it for
        rent. Your property or properties will not be listed until we are
        satisfied it is in fact valid and the listing steps have been met.{' '}
        <span>
          Property managers are <span>expressively forbidden</span> from listing
          less than they rent.{' '}
        </span>
        Any attempt to bait and switch travelers into another unit you manage
        but have not listed will result in firm and immediate disciplinary
        steps. We take a very strict and negative view of this and will suspend
        your account immediately upon the first violation of our listing policy
        and will outright ban for a 2nd violation. Our annual subscriptions are
        very affordable and are designed to ensure everyone receives a fair deal
        in exchange for the privilege of listing with us.
