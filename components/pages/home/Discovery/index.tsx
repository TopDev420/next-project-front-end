        Why stay in a cramped-up hotel room when you can stay in one of our
        vacation rental properties direct from a local homeowner? When you
        inquire about one of our listings, you are dealing directly with the
        actual homeowner or property manager. All contracts, directions,
        information, payments and assistance are handled by the person who knows
        it best â€“ the homeowner! We just make the introductions and leave the
        rest to you
